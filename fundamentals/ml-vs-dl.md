# Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Machine Learning

A subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed.

- Trained with large sets of data
- They learn from examples
- They do not follow rules-based algorithms

## Deep Learning

A specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making.

## Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

- Data Science is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data
- It involves mathematics statistical analysis data visualization machine learning and more.
