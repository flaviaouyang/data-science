# Data Mining

## Establish Goals

1. Identify key questions that need to be answered
2. Estimate the costs and benefits
3. Determine the expected level of accuracy

## Select Data

- When data are not available, identify other sources of data or plan new data collection initiatives.
- The type, size, and frequency of data have a direct bearing on the cost of data mining exercise.

## Preprocess Data

- Identify the irrelevant attributes of data and expunge such attributes from further consideration.
- Identify the erroneous aspects of data set and flagging them.
- Data should be subject to checks to ensure integrity.

## Transform data

- Determine the appropriate format in which the data should be stored.
- May require Data reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis.

## Store Data

- The data must be stored in a format that gives unrestricted and immediate read/write privileges to the data scientist.

## Mine Data

- This step covers data analysis methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
- A good starting point for data mining is data visualization.

## Evaluate Mine Results

- Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see how effective and efficient the algorithms have been in reproducing data. 
- This is known as an "in-sample forecast".
