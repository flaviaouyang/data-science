# Regression Model

We will explore the workings of regression models, which have become the workhorse of statistical analysis. In almost all empirical pursuits of research, either in the academic or professional fields, the use of regression models, or their variants, is ubiquitous. In medical science, regression models are being used to develop more effective medicines, improve the methods for operations, and optimize resources for small and large hospitals. In the business world, regression models are at the forefront of analyzing consumer behavior, firm productivity, and competitiveness of public and privateÂ­ sector entities.
